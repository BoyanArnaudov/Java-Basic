# JavaBasic
The "Programming Basics" course includes writing program code at an entry level (basic coding skills), working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results ), using conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).Here are uploaded almost all the exercises that I had to solve while learning Programing Basics with Java in SoftUni.
