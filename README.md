# JavaBasic
The "Programming Basics" course includes writing program code at an entry level (basic coding skills), working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results ), using conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while, nested).Here are uploaded almost all the exercises that I had to solve while learning Programing Basics with Java in @SoftUni.
Skills that are acquired during this course:
- Working with the console (data input and output)
- Working with loops (for)
- Working with more complex logic checks (switch-case)
- Working with logical checks (if-else)
- Performing simple calculations
- Working with more complex loops (nested for loops and while loops)
